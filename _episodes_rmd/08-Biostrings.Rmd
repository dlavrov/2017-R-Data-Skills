title: Creating Publication-Quality Graphics
teaching: 60
exercises: 20
questions:
- "How can I create publication-quality graphics in R?"
objectives:
- "To be able to use ggplot2 to generate publication quality graphics."
- "To understand the basic grammar of graphics, including the aesthetics and geometry layers, adding statistics, transforming scales, and coloring or panelling by groups."
keypoints:
- "Use `ggplot2` to create plots."
- "Think about graphics in layers: aesthetics, geometry, statistics, scale transformation, and grouping."

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("08-")
# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", header = TRUE)

> ## Challenge 5
>
> Create a density plot of GDP per capita, filled by continent.
>
> Advanced:
>  - Transform the x axis to better visualise the data spread.
>  - Add a facet layer to panel the density plots by year.
